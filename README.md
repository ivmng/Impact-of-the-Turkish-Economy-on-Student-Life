In this project, we examined the data that we collected as a result of an online and face-to-face survey with the participation of 304 students from 37 different departments studying at Middle East Technical University,
including different variables about the Turkish economy and its relationship with students.
Our data includes a variety of information about our participants, including their demographic characteristics,
their views on the Turkish economy and how much it affects their educational lives, and multiple views on the psychological, academic, analytical, and performance impacts of the economy on them.
Using this data collected through an online survey and a face-to-face survey, topics about the impact of the economy on METU students and its impact on their future thinking were analyzed.
The results show that the economy has a significant impact on students' educational life and future development and affects their performance.
